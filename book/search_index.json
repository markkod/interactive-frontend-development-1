The\ndependencies usually target the NPM repository, but can target a public VCS\nrepository (e.g GitHub). The npm dependency management and installation\ntool can also be used, but yarn has mostly superceded it by much faster and\nhaving saner defaults.\n\nYarn\nNPM repository\nNPM CLI\n\nBuild scripts\nyarn build\nbuild refers to the build script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config\nwebpack.config.js from the command line.\nWebpack\nWebpack generates a JavaScript file (public/app.js) using the specified\nconfiguration file\n(webpack.config.js).\nWebpack resolves all module imports and outputs one file that can be included\nin the browser using a  tag. Various plugins can be included in the\nWebpack build process to perform additional changes to the source files.\nBabel\nJavaScript is a fast-changing language with many different runtimes (browsers\nand their versions). Babel allows using desired JavaScript features and syntax\nin the source code and transpiling the source code to be parseable and\nexecutable by various browsers and their versions.\nbabel-loader plugin is used (configured in webpack.config.js) to transpile\nfiles with Babel during the Webpack build process. It uses @babel/preset-env\nto target specific browsers(specified using browserlist) and also defines\nplugins that babel can use to further transform source code.\nCompare the distribution JavaScript file generated by yarn build with the\nfiles in src/.  Try running yarn build with different browser targets (i.e\nremove \"IE 10\") and see how the distribution file changes (search for class).\nBuilding on source file change\nyarn build:watch refers to the build:watch script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config\nwebpack.config.js --watch. The watch flag instructs Webpack to automatically\nrebuild the bundle whenever any source file changes. New changes are visible\nafter refreshing the web application in the browser.\nLearn more\nRefreshing whenever source files change\nyarn start refers to the start script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --open\n--config webpack.config.js. The open flag opens the default browser on the\nspecified port (default 8080) on localhost.\nTry changing\nsrc/index.js\nand see that the browser pages refreshes automatically once you save your\nchange.\nLearn more\nSource Maps\nwebpack.config.js\ndefines devtool: \"inline-source-map\" which instructs Webpack to add a link to\nthe source code definitions to the end of app.js.  This link is call a source\nmap.\nA source map is a file which maps the transformed source (app.js) to the\noriginal source (multiple files in src.js). In the current case, a source map\nisn't an URL to a file, but a base64 encoding of the whole source definition in\nbase64. A web-browser will map the generated file (app.js) to the original\nsource. This allows both the browser to execute JavaScript that it supports and\nthe developer to debug their original, unchanged source code.\nLearn more\n"},"lecture_1/linting.html":{"url":"lecture_1/linting.html","title":"Linting JavaScript source code","keywords":"","body":"Linting example (eslint)\nLinting source code\nyarn install\nyarn lint\nExpected behaviour\nThree errors are shown:\n\nLintFail.js: Unexpected var, use let or const instead\nLintFail.js: Strings must use singlequote quotes\nLintFail.js: Unexpected console statement\n\nEach error is caused by a specific rule,\n\nUnexpected var, use let or const instead: no-var\nStrings must use singlequote: quotes\nUnexpected console statement: no-console\n\nExplanation\nyarn lint refers to the lint script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/eslint src/ from the\ncommand line.  eslint will validate that JavaScript source files pass a rules\nthat help to avoid common errors or confusing code.  It also enforces\nformatting to an extent.\neslint ruleset is configured in\n.eslintrc.\n\nimport plugin is used to validate that import statements resolve\neslint:recommended and google rulesets are used as a baseline.\nsome rules are overridden by specifying them in \"rules\".\n\nLearn more\nMotivations for rules\nEach rule from eslint can be viewed at eslint rule documentation.  The\nmotivation and guidance on how to fix it (or when to turn it off) is given for\neach rule. Some rules can even be fixed automatically by running eslint with\nthe --fix option.\nFixing linting errors\nTry to fix the problems reported by eslint.\nIf a problem reported by eslint is not valid, rules can be disabled for a specific line or file.\nWarning: You should not do this in 99% of the cases. The linter cannot help\nyou if you disable it.\nDisabling eslint for a line:\nconsole.log('Hello world'); //eslint-disable-line no-console\n\nDisabling eslint for the whole file:\n/* eslint-disable no-console */\n\nconsole.log('Hello world');\n\nNote that different comment syntaxes are used for disabling lines versus whole\nfiles. This is to avoid accidentally disabling rules for the whole file. Such\ndisable statements should be use very sparingly, otherwise the purpose of\nlinting is defeated.\nLinting continuously\nLinting is useful to get immediate feedback about mistakes and is a much faster\nalternative to catching silly mistakes than testing manually in a web browser\nand watching out for execution errors. Configure your editor to run eslint\nautomatically when the source file changes.

There are\ntwo asynchronous action creators for posting a comment and fetching all\ncomments in\nCommentServerActions.\nThe asynchronous action creators make use of a fetch\nAPI which supports\nmaking requests to remote servers.\nNote that the asynchronous action creators do not return a plain-object action,\nbut a function. Returning a function is not supported natively by Redux, the\ncapability is added by redux-thunk middleware.\nRedux thunk\nRedux thunk middleware supports returning functions (thunks) from action\ncreators.  These functions are executed by the middleware with the dispatch\nfunction from store given as a parameter. This means that the thunk function\ncan call dispatch multiple times or at a later time.\nThunk functions usually call other, synchronous action creators to dispatch actions.\nExample:\nlet timer;\nexport const fetchComments = () => {\n  return dispatch => {\n    timer = setTimeout(\n      () => dispatch(receivedComments(['comment1', 'comment2'])),\n      1000\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nTesting\nComponents and reducers can be tested as usual.  Testing fetch API usage is\nachieved by using an optional parameter which defaults to window.fetch for\nthe asynchronous actions creators. Tests simply pass a stub function as the\noptional argument.\nRedux mock store\nRedux mock store is a very simple mock interface for a Redux store that records\nall received actions.
